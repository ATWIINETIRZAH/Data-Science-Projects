# SMS Spam Detection: A Machine Learning Approach

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam oR not spam. By analyzing a dataset of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham, we apply natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to accurately detect spam messages.
